# CXGNN
A GNN causal explainer based on a graph's causal structure and it's corresponding neural causal model. It outperforms the existing GNN explainers in exactly finding the ground-truth explanations.

## Background
As machine learning models take over real world tasks, there is an increasing requirement for being able to 
interpret why the model predicts what it does.
This repository implements a framework to get causal interpretations of an Artificial Neural Network for determining neuron and layer level causality.

## Contributions
> The first GNN causal explainer

> We leverage the neural-causal connection, design the GNN neural causal models, and train them to identify the causal explanatory subgraph.

> Our results show the effectiveness of CXGNN and its superiority over the state-of-the-art association-based and causality-inspired GNN explainers

## Method 
The workflow for determining causal variables for a particular prediction of the neural network is shown below. For example, you might want to understand why the neural network predicted that a particular image was a show.

## Results
### Synthetic
To demonstrate how our algorithm can seperate causal variables from spurious and non causal variables, we conduct a study comparing causal variables predicted by our algorithm with the Pearson Correlation Coefficient of each input variable with the output, as shown in Figure 1. We also verify this numerically via an ablation study.

### Real World Dataset
The [HELOC Dataset](https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge?tabset-3158a=2) (Home Equity Line of Credit) is an anonymized dataset provided by FICO.
The fundamental task is to predict credit risk. A simple ANN is trained for this, reaching 70% validation accuracy. Causal input variables and their ranges are found using the pipeline above.

Figure 1 and 2 both show how variables causal for a particular prediction are delineated by the algorithm. For example, Figure 2 shows that the variable 'External Risk Estimate' being between 42.5 to 52.8 is causal for a bad credit risk prediction.
